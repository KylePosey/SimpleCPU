# SimpleCPU
 A very simple software CPU implementation. 
 Still in the works, however, it currently has 15 fully working operations.
 
 My next two goals in mind:
	-Add remaining needed instructions such as branching and bitwise operations
	-Write an assembler so code can be written in primitive assembly rather than byte code
