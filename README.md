# SimpleCPU
 A very simple software CPU implementation. 
 Still in the works, however, it currently has 15 fully working operations.
 
 My next two goals in mind:
 <ul> 
	<li>Add remaining needed instructions such as branching and bitwise operations</li>
	<li>Write an assembler so code can be written in primitive assembly rather than byte code</li>
	<li>Create a terminal application that can be manipulated through code with a mapped io address space</li>
 </ul>
